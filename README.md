# AI Food

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

the main idea is to create a tool of Ai system that can suggest what to eat or what kind of recipe to do based on the ingredients present in the fridge. The main idea is to start from the incredients that I have in the fridge in order to select the recipe.  


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

The idea si to create a sort of serche engine with different filters that can match what you have in your fridge with recepies giving to you an idea of what to prepare for dinner/lunch. 

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1: to everyone which don't have any idea of what to eat when they come back home after a workday.
* problem 2: to everyone that have food intolerence or diet to follow. 
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?



## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
